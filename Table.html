            Top-10 most populated countries in the world are hosting 4.176 billion people in June 2014. China, India, America, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia and Japan are the top-10 most populated countries in the world. China is number one with 1.355 billion population in 2014, India is number two with 1.236 billion population.
        </p>

        <p>
            The United States of America, the 3rd most populated country in the world, hosts 319 million people, Indonesia has population of 253 million people, Brazil is on 5th position with 202 million population while Pakistan ranks 6th with population of 196 million in June 2014, according to the population data of the World Internet Stats.
        </p>

        <p>
            While research shows that total population in the world in 2014 is 7.181 billion. The Christians are number with over 2 billion population in the world while the Muslims are on the second position with more than 1.6 billion population in 2014. 
        </p>

        <p>
            At present China is the number one country in global population ranking with 1.356 billion population, but research indicates that by the 2050, India would emerge as the number one country with expected population of 1.6 billion. China's population is being estimated at 1.303 billion by 2050 as against current population of 1.355 billion as China has adopted One-Child policy while population growth rate in India is 1.41 percent while population growth rate in China is 0.5 percent. However, two-children policy of China, announced in 2018, might change the scenario and keep it the world's number one in population.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dear readers there are a total of 192 countries in the world that are the members of the United Nations out of which 49 countries are Muslim countries. Muslims population is about 1.6 billion in 2014, the second largest population on this planet.
        </p>

        <p>
            India is projected to be the world’s most populous country by 2050, surpassing China, its (Indian) population reaching 1.6 billion by 2050. India’s population growth rate is 1.41%. Indian population reached the billion mark in 2000.
        </p>

        <p>
            India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan. India has more than two thousand ethnic groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            The world population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine and the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million. The highest growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred briefly during the 1950s, and for longer during the 1960s and 1970s. The global growth rate peaked at 2.2% in 1963, and has declined to below 1.1% as of 2012.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2012 UN projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate; global population is expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources.
